# Swift Model Generator

## Problem.

- You can search with key words "Swift Model Generator" with google and get a lot of results but none of them suitable for your project?
- I know that we already used difference method to convert JSON to Model. (ObjectMapper, ModelMapper...)
- You already think about make a tool for your project but it will take alot of time.

## Solution.

- Here is an example for you to build a generator tool base on [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/tristanhimmelman/ObjectMapper) model.
- If this still not suiltable for your project you can customize and build a new one.
